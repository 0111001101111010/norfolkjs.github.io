One of the most exciting trends in JavaScript is the integration with WebGL to accelerate graphics to render 3D in the browser. What was once considered the domain of C++, super computers with specialized graphics hardware, or more recently beefed up gamer desktops, can now be done on our smart phone with some JavaScript, CSS and HTML. You don't need to to know legacy programming languages or how to do brain-hurting matrix math.
Kevin will present on the latest in JavaScript in 3D, covering the emerging but popular libraries three.js, D3 and others. Kevin will also share the work being done right here in Hampton Roads through a technology called Bridgeworks that Kevin helped create. The audience will leave with a thorough review of the technology space and some easy ways to start dabbling or go deeper with their existing JavaScript abilities.

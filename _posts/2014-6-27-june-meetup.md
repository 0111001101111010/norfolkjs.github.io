Node Workshop


<p>Instead of our typical Monday meetup, this month we will be having our first Friday evening beginner workshop. Kevin Griffin (HRNUG) will be presenting an interactive talk to get people started using Node.js with Express to create web applications. We will also have some JavaScript ninjas ready for hands-on help and pair programming during and after the talk.</p>


<p>If you have a laptop, we encourage that you bring it, pre-installed with Node.js if possible. If you'd like to try our Node development VM, you can follow the instructions
<a href="https://github.com/norfolkjs/node-vagrant/README.md">here</a></p>

<p>If you don't have a portable computer, no worries, we'll try to find you a loaner or a pairing partner.</p>

<p>Also, if you're totally new to JavaScript, you'll want to get a basic understanding of JavaScript syntax before the workshop: <a href="https://github.com/norfolkjs/general-info/wiki#resources">beginner JavaScript resources</a>.</p>

<p>Food and soda will be provided by SSI <a href="http://www.supersystemsinc.com/" class="linkified">http://www.supersystemsinc.com/</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in attending this event as a mentor, please contact one of the organizers! We need you :)</p>
